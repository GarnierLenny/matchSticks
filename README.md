# matchSticks
matchSticks is a turn-based game where the goal is to make the enemy remove the last match

After cloning this repository, type "make" to generate to "matchSticks" binary.
To launch the game type "./matchSticks" followed by the number of floors you want to play with and the maximum number of match(es) that you'll be able to remove at once.
If the bot removes the last match you win, if you are the one to remove the last match you lose.
For now this game is only playable against a bot.
This project isn't finished, I'll keep you updated.

Thanks for playing do not hesitate to give me feedback and/or rate my project !
